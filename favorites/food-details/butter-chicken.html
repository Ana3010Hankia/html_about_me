    <h2>Why I Love Butter Chicken</h2>
    <p>Butter chicken is the perfect comfort food for me. The rich, creamy tomato-based sauce combined with tender chicken pieces creates an explosion of flavors that never gets old.</p>
    
    <h3>What Makes It Special</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Perfect balance of spices - not too hot, not too mild</li>
        <li>Creamy texture that's incredibly satisfying</li>
        <li>Goes perfectly with basmati rice or naan bread</li>
        <li>Reminds me of cozy dinner nights</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Best Places I've Had It</h3>
    <p>While I've enjoyed butter chicken at many restaurants, the best ones always have that perfect balance of sweetness and spice, with chicken that melts in your mouth.</p>
