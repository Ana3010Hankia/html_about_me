  <p>Ramen is a popular Japanese noodle soup consisting of wheat noodles served in a flavorful broth, often topped with meats, vegetables, and seasonings. It is celebrated for its rich taste and comforting warmth.</p>

  <h2>Why I Like This Food</h2>
  <p>I enjoy ramen because it’s both hearty and customizable. The combination of flavorful broth, chewy noodles, and fresh toppings makes each bowl unique and satisfying.</p>

  <h2>What I Like About It</h2>
  <p>I love how ramen blends textures and flavors — the richness of the broth, the tenderness of the meat, the crunch of vegetables, and the soft noodles create a perfect balance. The variety of broths, such as miso, shoyu, and tonkotsu, means there’s always something new to enjoy.</p>
