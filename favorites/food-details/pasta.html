<h2>Why I Like This Food</h2>
    <p>
    Alfredo pasta is rich, creamy, and comforting, making it a perfect indulgence.
    The combination of butter, cream, and Parmesan cheese creates a smooth, luscious sauce that satisfies cravings for something warm and flavorful.
    It's both simple and elegant, reminding me of cozy family dinners and special occasions.

<h2>What I Like About It</h2>
    <p>
    I love the silky texture of the Alfredo sauce that coats every strand of pasta evenly.
    The cheesy, buttery flavor is comforting yet luxurious. 
    Alfredo pasta is versatile — I can add chicken, mushrooms, or veggies to keep it interesting.
    It’s quick to prepare but tastes like a restaurant-quality dish.
